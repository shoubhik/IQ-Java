     write down the recurrence:

     sum(i,j) = max_k sum(i,k) + sum(k+1, j)
     This will give an O(N^3) solution. A brute force summing of the
     sequences will give the same
     time.

     subsequence sum. If that
     sum ever drops below zero, that subsequence will not contribute to the
     subsequent maximal
     subsequence since it would reduce it by adding the negative sum.
